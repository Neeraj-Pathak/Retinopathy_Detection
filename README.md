# 👁️ Automatic Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using CNN

A deep learning-based solution to automatically detect and classify the stages of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), U-Net segmentation, and denoising techniques to achieve high accuracy in DR detection and grading.

## 🧠 Introduction

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness. Early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk. This project proposes an automated DR detection system using CNN, aiming for accurate, fast, and scalable screening, especially useful in rural or resource-constrained areas.
